@article{Sethna1993,
annote = {	Highly cited on Web of Science. Vives cites it. Referenced in Sornette's book, as discussing "sweeping toward a critical point" (as opposed to S.O.C.).
	I think this is the first of the Sethna groups RFIM papers.
	Mentions use of the model in porous materials.
	Uses random field model in $3-d$.
	Disusses first-order transitions generally, including hysteresis, return point memory, and avalanches.
	Finds a critical value of the disorder (the width of the continuous bond distribution); below this value the magnetization changes in a `burst' (ie. infinite avalanche), and above it it changes in many small avalanches ($M(H)$ is a power-law singularity and there are avalanches of all sizes).
	Uses a pretty basic mean field theory to approximate some of the critical exponents.
	Examines size distribution of avalanches near the critical point.
	Has some interesting but vague discussing of experimental systems, with references.},
